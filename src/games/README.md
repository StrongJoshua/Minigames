#Running the Games
To download the runnable Jar file for any of the games here simply click on it and choose "View Raw". This will download the .jar file to your computer for you to run.
##Hangman
Hangman runs solely using a GUI, so just follow its instructions to play. The game does not support single-player because it requires someone to input the word to be guessed.
